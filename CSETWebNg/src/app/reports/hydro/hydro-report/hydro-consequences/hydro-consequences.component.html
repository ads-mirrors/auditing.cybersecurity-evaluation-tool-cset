            Consequences are the effects of having a control not implemented 
            or partially implemented. There are five consequences that are 
            attributed to each of the controls: Denial-of-service, 
            Natural disaster/Physical Attack, Integrity based attack, 
            Data-breach, and Ransomware. The chart to the right shows the 
            breakdown of {{facilityName}}â€™s consequence likelihood breakdown based on answers in the assessment.
