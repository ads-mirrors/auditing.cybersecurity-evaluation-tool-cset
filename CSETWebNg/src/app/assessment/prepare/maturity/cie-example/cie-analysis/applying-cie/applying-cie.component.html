  <h2>Applying CIE within the Utility</h2>
  <p>
    Utility operations and engineering projects are always ongoing.
    Because of this, the utility decided to identify how CIE would be
    applied from the beginning for engineering projects. This resulted
    in the following conclusions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Throughout the CIE process flow, organizational culture consistently includes cybersecurity in alignment with
      full implementation of CIE.</li>
    <li>CIE begins with Consequence-Focused Design. This is the first step in identifying critical functions and
      catastrophic consequences. Once the critical functions, supporting systems, assets, and staff are described and
      understood, potential consequences are identified, and engineered controls are identified and implemented to
      eliminate or mitigate the highest consequences.</li>
    <li>Once the highest consequences are addressed, the focus then shifts to securing the information architecture
      (Secure Information Architecture) to ensure the confidentiality, availably, and integrity of data. As these
      principles are applied throughout the engineering lifecycle, Design simplification helps reduce the potential for
      vulnerabilities and associated risks that could potentially outweigh the benefits they bring to the system and
      organization.</li>
    <li>Even with the protections and mitigations from the prior principles, the utility establishes layered defenses.
      This helps prevent cascading failures if one element of the digital system becomes compromised. When assuming
      highly capable and well-resourced adversaries, active defense becomes critical for the operations staff to monitor
      the resilience of their systems. This principle supports operation when a threat is detected, and isolation or
      removal of the threat without compromising critical operations.</li>
    <li>Conducting an interdependency evaluation within the design process and regular updates through operations,
      maintenance, and retirement is necessary to maintain an up-to-date understanding of risk. The next step involves
      establishing digital asset awareness through compiling a complete and accurate digital asset inventory, enabling
      the evaluation and elimination of potential consequences arising from new vulnerabilities. This helps operations
      and supporting staff to address system or devicespecific vulnerabilities as they are discovered, and better
      understand the full scope of capabilities (enabled or not) of the digital devices in the system.</li>
    <li>Planned resilience begins in the early engineering phases and is maintained and updated through the entire
      engineering lifecycle. Assuming that any digital component or system may be compromised and planning for continued
      operation during and after a cyber-attack that degrades digital controls throughout the system is essential to the
      utility’s maturing cybersecurity culture.</li>
    <li>Engineering information control protects sensitive engineering records that may facilitate a successful
      cyber-attack. Preventing information from unauthorized release increases the difficulty for an attacker to
      successfully carry out their mission against the utility. Engineering information control and establishing
      cyber-secure supply chains help maintain secure and resilient operations. These must also be applied contractually
      and in practice for a</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>CIE Control and Mitigation Examples</h2>
  <p>
    This narrative provides a summary of the concerns and associated
    controls and/ or mitigations each CIE principle helps the utility
    identify. Each example is focused on one specific CIE principle but
    frequently uses other principles in CIE to achieve a more secure
    and robust design. The matrices in the CIE Analysis Matrix below
    can be used to quickly identify which CIE principles are relevant
    to each CIE control and mitigation example. For each CIE control
    and mitigation example, a select concept question from the
    Implementation Guide is included to illustrate how the question
    helped shape the utility’s approach to CIE.
