    <h2>Engineering Lifecycle Phase and CIE Principle Cross Reference Matrix</h2>
    <p>
        Tables below organize the CIE controls and mitigations identified below according
        to either the related principles or the engineering lifecycle phase of implementation.
        In the first table, each action, abbreviated from the description below, identifies a
        primary CIE Principle and secondary related principles. For example, the CIE control
        or mitigations associated primarily with Principle 3: Secure Information Architecture
        are also associated with Principle 1: Consequence-Focused Design and Principle 6: Active Defense.
        The second table presents CIE controls and mitigations mapped to the engineering lifecycle phase
        that they are first associated with. The examples associated with Principle 6: Active Defense,
        are first associated with Testing, Verification, Validation, and Deployment (TVVD)/Construction and
        Commissioning.
