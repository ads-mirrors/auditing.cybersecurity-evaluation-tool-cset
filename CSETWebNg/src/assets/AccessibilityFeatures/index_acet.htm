            ACET Accessibility Features
        </h1>

        <p>
            The features and functions within ACET have been developed
            to support application users with accessibility requirements. Industry
            standards have been followed to take advantage of accessibility features built
            into the Windows operating system and the .NET architecture. These combined
            capabilities support compliance with Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation
            Act.
        </p>


        <p>
            <span class="underline header-color font-weight-bold">Analysis:</span>

            Accessibility for the analysis functionality
            can be accomplished by printing the reports or producing an on-screen version
            of the reports. Reports are generated in .HTML format.
        </p>


        <h2>
            High Contrast Functionality
        </h2>

        <p>
            All text areas on ACET other than the Diagram and Analysis
            pages support switching to High Contrast mode within the Windows operating
            system.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Keyboard Access
        </h2>

        <p>
            ACET is accessible from the keyboard. All areas of the
            application other than the Analysis page can be accessed from the keyboard.
            Most keyboard access is implemented by using the TAB and ARROW keys for
            navigation, the SPACE and ENTER keys for selection.
            Additional shortcut or hot keys may be found in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog.
