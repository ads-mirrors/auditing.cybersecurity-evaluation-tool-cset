<h1>Importance of Cybersecurity Assessments</h1>
<p>
    The rapid migration of the public and private sector to a digital economy has made the
    risk of cyber-attacks extremely high in recent years. The business continuity of an
    enterprise is now strongly dependent on the strength of its cybersecurity controls,
    cybersecurity awareness of its employees and contractors and standard business processes
    that minimize exposure to attacks. The cost to an organization for a cybersecurity incident
    on a critical hydropower system can include direct Ô¨Ånancial loss, physical damage, severe
    reputation impact, and even loss of life. These consequences influence other impact categories
    such as environmental, economic, safety, and operational. Hydropower plants face numerous
    challenges in making informed decisions in managing upgrades and maintaining systems to ensure
    continuity of operations. Regular cybersecurity assessments that enable a risk-based approach
    to allocating resources and improving the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization is
    paramount in ensuring the security and resiliency of hydropower facilities. CVF was built to
    enable a comprehensive and periodic cybersecurity risk assessment that informs investment decisions.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks serve as reference guides
    in building the CVF assessment structure as well as the scoring methodology.

    The remainder of this report is organized to provide a high-level summary followed by more
    detailed analysis of weak points categorized by CVF assessment, as well as their domains and subdomains.
