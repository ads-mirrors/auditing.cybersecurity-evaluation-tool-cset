    <h4>
        Introduction
    </h4>
    <p>
        On {{ model?.assessmentDetails.assessmentDate | localizeDate }}, {{ model?.assessmentDetails.facilityName
        ?? '[Facility Name]' }} conducted a Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) Self-Assessment. Answers to questions
        about cybersecurity practices were gathered from key stakeholders within {{
        model?.assessmentDetails.facilityName ?? '[Facility Name]' }} and scored.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4>Overview and Scope of the CRR</h4>
    <p>
        The CRR consists of a one-day, structured facilitation and interview of key personnel. The
        primary goal of the CRR is to develop an understanding and qualitative measurement of
        essential cybersecurity capabilities. Personnel are asked to describe how these capabilities are
        institutionalized and managed, and how these capabilities are applied to support the organization
        during times of stress. The assessment questions asked participants to articulate evidence
        regarding both performances of cybersecurity practices as well as sustainment of those practices
        over time. Individual organizations are examined for specific capacities and capabilities in
        defining, managing, and measuring cybersecurity practices and behaviors, as described in
        categories. The categories examined are:

    <h4>About this Report</h4>
    <p>
        The CRR has a service orientation, meaning that one of the foundational principles of its
        design is the idea that an organization deploys its people, information, technology and
        facilities to support specific operational missions. During the CRR, this focus on services
        is how {{ model?.assessmentDetails.facilityName ?? '[Facility Name]' }} improves its understanding of the
        cybersecurity management of services that support
        critical infrastructure. This improved understanding helps the organization focus its efforts
        in improving cybersecurity management.
    </p>

    <p *ngIf="model?.criticalService">
        For this assessment, the critical infrastructure service is {{ model?.criticalService }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        This report summarizes the assessment findings and provides your organization with options for
        consideration in each category. The options for consideration aim to provide general guidelines or
        activities as to how your organization can improve the organization's cybersecurity posture and
        preparedness. These options are not meant to fully represent all activities needed for a robust
        cybersecurity management program, but to provide initial guidance on how to incorporate various
        cybersecurity practices including CERT® Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), National
        Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST), and other cybersecurity standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that guidance provided in this report includes National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) Special Publications. While the primary audience for these documents is United
        States Federal Civilian Agencies, NIST encourages the adoption of these guidelines by State, local,
        and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations. Guidance from the NIST
        Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity is also
        included. The Framework, created through collaboration between industry and government,
        consists of standards, guidelines, and practices to promote the protection of critical
        infrastructure. Additionally, while the CRR bases its questions and options for consideration on
        CERT-RMM, the results do not constitute a formal “rating” and should not be interpreted as a
        formal appraisal of your organization against CERT-RMM. Detailed information about the RMM can
        be found at <a href="https://www.cert.org/resilience" target="_blank">www.cert.org/resilience</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An additional benefit of the CRR is that it allows an organization to compare its capabilities to the
        criteria of the NIST CSF. This comparison is provided in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
        Summary and provides the basis for understanding where improvements could be made.
    </p>
    <p>
        A reference crosswalk mapping the relationship of the CRR goals and practices to the NIST CSF
        categories and subcategories is included in the CRR Self-Assessment Kit.

        Cyber Resilience Review Results
    </h4>
    <p>
        The CRR is an interview-based assessment. It is understood that participants often do not have
        complete knowledge of an organization's operations. Actual performance may vary from what is
        indicated in this report. Organizational performance is presented across several dimensions within
        the report. Scores are provided for individual Practices, Goals, and Domains.

            Maturity Indicator Levels
        </h4>
        <p>
            Maturity Indicator Levels (MIL) are assigned by Domain and represent a consolidated view of
            performance. CERT-RMM MILs describe attributes that would be indicative of mature capabilities
            as represented in the model's capability levels. However, they do not fully represent capability
            levels as defined because a capability level can only be assigned through a formal appraisal
            process, not as the result of using an assessment-based instrument.
        </p>

        <div class="font-weight-bold fst-italic">MIL0 Incomplete</div>
        <p>
            Indicates that Practices in the Domain are not being performed as measured by responses to the
            relevant CRR questions. If MIL0 is assigned, no further assessment of maturity indicator is
            performed.
        </p>

        <div class="font-weight-bold fst-italic">MIL1 Performed</div>
        <p>
            Indicates that all Practices in a Domain are being performed as measured by responses to the
            relevant CRR questions. MIL1 means that there is sufficient and substantial support for the
            existence of the practices.

                is assigned to staff who are responsible and accountable for the performance of the practice
                (Have staff been assigned to perform the practice and are they responsible and accountable
                for the performance of the practice?)
            </li>
            <li style="page-break-inside: auto;">
                is performed by staff who are adequately trained to perform the practice (Are the staff who

            <li>
                produces work products that are expected from performance of the practice and are placed
                under appropriate levels of configuration control (Does the practice produce artifacts and
                work products that are expected from performing the practice, and if so, are the
                configurations of these artifacts/work products managed?)

            and consistent across all internal[1] constituencies who have a vested interest in the performance
            of the practice. A defined process/practice ensures that the organization reaps the benefits of
            consistent performance of the practice across organizational units and that all organizational units
            can benefit from improvements realized in any organizational unit. At MIL5, a process/practice

        <ul>
            <li>
                is defined by the organization and tailored by organizational units for their use (Is there an
                organization-sponsored definition of the practice from which organizational units can derive
                practices that fit their unique operating circumstances?)
            </li>
            <li>
                is supported by improvement information that is collected by and shared among

        [1] In this case, “internal” refers to constituencies over which the organization has direct managerial
        control.
