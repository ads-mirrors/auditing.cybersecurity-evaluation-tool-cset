        target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Strategy of 2023</a> called for a large-scale shift to secure-by-design
      approaches for the digital ecosystem that underpins U.S. critical infrastructure systems. For energy
      infrastructure in particular, it explicitly recommends implementing the Congressionally-directed
      <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/FINAL%20DOE%20National%20CIE%20Strategy%20-%20June%202022_0.pdf"
        target="_blank">National CIE Strategy</a> to proactively build in cybersecurity. The Implementation Guide takes
      a crucial step to do just that—providing guidance for engineers to incorporate CIE throughout the design and
      engineering process and meeting a key National CIE Strategy recommendation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The National CIE Strategy was developed by an executive task force, assembled by the U.S. Department of Energy
      (DOE)’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), that included energy sector
      asset owners and operators, vendors and manufacturers, standards organizations, research and academic
      institutions, National Laboratories, and government agencies. It outlines strategic recommendations across five
      pillars of action, including raising awareness of CIE, building CIE into engineering education and accreditation,
      developing a body of knowledge and resources for CIE, and implementing CIE in both existing systems and future
      infrastructure designs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the strategy’s publication in June 2022, the CIE initiative has continued to grow and evolve, with multiple
      efforts under way to implement key strategy recommendations. Bolstering these efforts is the CIE Community of
      Practice, which has formed with more than 200 practitioners to help translate CIE concepts into technical
      requirements and drive the development of a robust CIE body of knowledge and resources—including the
      Implementation Guide.

      <strong>March 2017:</strong> <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1369373" target="_blank">Cyber-Informed
        Engineering White Paper</a>—Researchers at Idaho National Laboratory first began to define a CIE approach in
      2017, identifying a set of principles to consider when solving an engineering problem. In the intervening years,
      those principles have been refined and revised in subsequent research efforts and publications. The Implementation
      Guide now offers the most current and granular identification of CIE principles to date. This white paper was
      prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy under DOE Idaho Operations Office Contract
      DE-AC07-05ID14517.
