        This chart shows subject areas needing the most attention. Each bar represents the labeled subject area's
        weighted contribution
        so that the combined total always equals 100%. The weighted contribution includes the importance of both
        the
        question and the subject area, as well as the percentage of missed questions in that subject area.
