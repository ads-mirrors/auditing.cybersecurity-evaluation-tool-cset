        <span *ngIf="!!displayName && displayName.length > 0 && displayName !== '...'">for {{displayName}}</span>
    </h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Representatives of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) conducted an External Dependencies
        Management Assessment (EDM Assessment) at your organization. The EDM Assessment focuses on
        practices to manage risks associated with external dependencies, especially risks related to information
        and communications technology (ICT). This type of risk &mdash; also commonly called supply chain or third
        party risk &mdash; is of particular concern to many organizations, which increasingly have a large number of
        external dependencies. Organizations face inherent uncertainty in managing complex, rapidly
        changing, arms-length relationships involving technology. They also face a threat environment that
        exacerbates these concerns. The EDM Assessment helps by providing an efficient, effective way to
        measure and report on an organization's capability to manage this risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        External dependencies exist when external entities have defined obligations or relationships with assets
        or services that your organization requires to support its business objectives and mission. Examples
        include third parties that provide, operate, control, have access to, own, or have other responsibilities
        over key ICT and related assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Assessment is based on the principle that external dependencies require systematic management
        over their lifecycle. It poses a series of questions that provide insights into how an organization can
        improve its ability to manage dependency risks. Answers were gathered from key staff and
        subsequently scored according to a system similar to the Department of Homeland Security Cyber
        Resilience Review (CRR). The details are provided below.
    </p>



    <h2 id="toc_overview">2. Overview and Scope of the External Dependencies Management Assessment (EDM Assessment)</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The EDM Assessment consists of a structured, facilitated interview of key personnel which takes a half
            day to complete. Its goal is to measure and report on the organization's cybersecurity practices as they
            relate to managing external dependencies and their associated risks. The assessment is derived from
            the Department of Homeland Security Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) and the external dependencies
            management process area of the Carnegie Mellon University CERT® Resilience Management Model
            (CERT-RMM). All of these resilience management resources use a common methodology. This
            provides an organized, actionable approach to managing cybersecurity risk based on a comprehensive
            array of industry standards and leading practices.
        </p>

        <div style="background-color: #d6e0f5; border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em; margin: 4% 0">
            External Dependencies Management establishes and manages an appropriate level of controls to
            ensure the resilience of services and assets that are dependent on the actions of external entities.
            (CERT Resilience Management Model, 2010)
        </div>

        <p>
            The EDM Assessment's approach is broad in that the organization is assessed against a range of
            external dependencies. Examples of dependencies include external entities that provide
        </p>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 4%;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">services that explicitly involve the operation, maintenance, or
                provisioning
                of ICT for the
                organization. Examples of these services include cloud services, data hosting, on-site
                maintenance services, and the operation of control systems to support the organization.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">services supported by ICT, including any type of service that is
                appreciably
                supported through
                the use of information and communications technology. Examples vary by critical infrastructure
                sector. In the energy sector, they may involve upstream or downstream components that extract
                or transport energy. In the financial sector, examples may include the printing of account
                statements by the subcontractor to a banking institution.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">governmental services, such as fire and police response to protect data
                centers. or
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">infrastructure services such as electricity, telecommunications networks,
                or
                transportation assets.</li>
            <li>technology products and services such as hardware and software that is utilized by the
                organization to provided services to its customers.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>2.1 Flexibility of the Approach</h3>
        <p>
            The EDM Assessment is designed to be a universal assessment method to evaluate the external
            dependency risk and resilience management capabilities of any critical infrastructure organization,
            regardless of the sector or the critical service the organization provides. It is intended to be useful
            regardless of whether the organization has well-defined resilience and risk management processes, is
            undertaking an effort to improve their resilience and risk management processes, or is just starting to
            examine the subject of external dependency risk. Ultimately, it is up to individual organizations to
            determine which EDM domains and practices are most relevant to their needs.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Critical Service Scope</h3>
        <p>
            The EDM Assessment has a service orientation, meaning that it is intended to assess the
            organization's management of external dependencies relative to a specific critical service. A critical
            service is defined as:
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 1em 0 1em 4em;">
            A set of activities an organization carries out in the performance of a duty or in the
            production of a product that is so critical to the organization's success that its disruption
            would severely impact continued operations or success in meeting the organization's
            mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organizations typically have a set of critical services that define their mission. The selection of a
            critical
            service for assessment &mdash; rather than assessing the organization as a whole &mdash; helps to scope
            the
            assessment and tie the results to the organization's mission capabilities. For your organization the
            critical service assessed was:
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2 id="toc_interpreting">3. Interpreting this Report</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            External dependencies involve acquiring and using ICT-related goods and services from external
            entities (third parties). Therefore, your organization is referred to as the “acquirer” in this report.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report summarizes assessment findings and provides options for consideration in each category.
            These options outline general guidelines or activities that can be used to improve External
            Dependencies Management and the resilience of the critical service assessed. Sources include the
            CERT® Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM), SEI-CMMI for Acquisition, National Institute of
            Standards and Technology (NIST) resources, the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), International
            Standards Organization (ISO) documents, and other cybersecurity standards. This material is not
            intended to fully represent all activities needed for a robust EDM program, but does provide initial
            guidance on how to incorporate various cybersecurity practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guidance provided in this report includes NIST Special Publications and the NIST Cybersecurity
            Framework developed in conjunction with the private sector. These documents are extensively used by
            United States Federal civilian agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and private sector
            organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EDM Assessment is an interview-based assessment. No documentary evidence or artifacts are
            examined or obtained during the assessment. Organizational performance is presented across several
            dimensions (e.g., contracts, third party oversight, controls, disruption management, and situational
            awareness) within the report. Scores are provided for individual Practices, Goals, and Domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the EDM Assessment is derived in part from CERT RMM, the results do not constitute a formal
            appraisal against it. Detailed information about CERT-RMM can be found at <a
                href="https://www.cert.org/resilience" target="_blank">www.cert.org/resilience</a>.
            Options for Consideration appearing in italics have been derived from the Specific Goals (SG) and
            Specific Practices (SP) sections of CERT-RMM.

        <h3>3.1 EDM Assessment Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The EDM Assessment examines organizations for specific EDM practices and capabilities. They are
            organized into three domains that support the lifecycle of external relationships.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Relationship Formation &mdash; activities that support the formation of
                relationships and
                dependencies
                on external entities. They include planning how the organization forms relationships, the
                selection and evaluation of suppliers and other entities, managing formal agreements, and
                incorporating EDM into the organization's risk management processes.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Relationship Management and Governance &mdash; ongoing management of
                external
                dependencies.
                Relationship management and governance includes a range of capabilities, such as ongoing
                risk management, supplier performance management, integrating external entities into internal
                processes such as change and capacity management, managing supplier transitions, and
                controlling the access of external entities to the organization.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Service Protection and Sustainment &mdash; incorporates dependence on
                external entities
                into the
                organization's processes to protect and sustain high-value services. These activities include
                situational awareness, service continuity, and incident management.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The assessment also evaluates the organization's capability to sustain and refine these practices over
            time. These questions involve the planning, governance, measurement and standardization of EDM
            practices so that they are retained and effective during times of stress and disruption. Collectively,
            the
            organization's performance of basic practices and higher levels of practice to sustain an EDM capability
            comprise its maturity. This is described in Section 3.4.
        </p>


        <h3>3.2 External Entity Types</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations typically rely on a range of different external entities to help them satisfy their
            mission
            and provide critical services. The organization's ability to manage these third parties may vary widely
            based on factors that include the degree of choice an organization has in selecting suppliers or other
            external entities; the organization's ability to drive behavior at the external entity; and the specific
            services provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            To comprehensively measure the EDM capability of the organization and ensure completeness, several
            questions ask about practices performed with respect to different types of external entities. The
            external
            entity types used are
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Supplier</span> &mdash; external entities that provide ICT-related
            goods and services and with which the
            acquirer has some ability to negotiate. These entities may also be called subcontractors or
            vendors. Depending on scoping and the needs of the organization, this category may also apply
            to supporting affiliates or separate business units of the larger enterprise. Examples of these
            suppliers include centrally managed IT or other business services. These relationships are
            sometimes governed by Operational Level Agreements.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Governmental services</span> &mdash; services provided by a
            governmental department or agency. These
            services frequently involve security; for example fire, police, and emergency response. Other
            examples include postal services and cybersecurity information providers like the CISA National
            Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Infrastructure providers</span> &mdash; supplies goods or services to a
            region, economy, infrastructure
            sector, or political subdivision; however, the acquirer normally has no commercially practical
            ability to negotiate with this type of supplier. Examples of infrastructure providers include natural
            gas, water, power, or transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
            These entity types are defined more fully in the glossary (79).
        </p>


        <h3>3.3 Asset Types</h3>
        <p>
            A fundamental principle in the EDM Assessment is that organizations depend on a variety of ICT or
            cyber-related assets to provide critical services. External dependencies frequently exist when third
            parties have obligations or other relationships with respect to these assets. To support the accuracy
            and completeness of the assessment, several questions involve specific practices with respect to each
            category of assets. These asset categories are
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">People</span> &mdash; for example, the staff that support data centers
            or otherwise use information and communications technology
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Information</span> &mdash; for example, account information and
            personal health information
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Technology</span> &mdash; for example, computers, software, and control
            systems
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">Facilities</span> &mdash; for example, offices or data centers.
        </p>


        <h3>3.4 Maturity Indicator Levels</h3>
        <p>
            A Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) is assigned to the organization's External Dependencies Management
            capability. It represents a consolidated view of performance. The EDM maturity indicator level is
            automatically scored by the assessment tool and is displayed graphically for easy reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maturity Indicator Levels describe attributes that are indicative of mature capabilities as represented
            in
            CERT-RMM. However, they are not a formal appraisal or certification of maturity, which are only
            assigned through a formal appraisal process that includes examination of documentation and other
            artifacts.

                    constituencies who have a vested interest in the performance of the practice. A
                    defined process or practice ensures that an enterprise benefits from consistent
                    processes across organizational units and that lessons learned are shared
                    across the enterprise. The MIL-5 level of maturity is sometimes more relevant
                    for larger enterprises charged with managing or providing guidance to
                    dispersed business units. At MIL-5, a process or practice

                            process for their own unique operating environment? An example
                            might include dealing with local or jurisdictional legal differences when

            The EDM Assessment uses one maturity scale for all three domains because the domains represent
            different parts of a lifecycle - from forming external relationships to managing incidents and
            consequences - rather than representing a fundamentally different capability. Ideally, higher level
            management should manage, measure, and oversee the organization's external dependencies
            management capability across this complete lifecycle.

        <h3>3.5 Assessment Scoring Rules</h3>
        <span>This section describes the scoring rules that are used in the EDM Assessment.</span>
        <ol style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">Practices are either performed (answer =”Yes”), incompletely performed
                (answer =
                “Incomplete”), or not performed (answer = “No”).</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">A goal is achieved only if all practices are performed.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">A Domain is achieved at MIL-1 if all the Goals in the Domain are
                achieved.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 2%;">External Dependencies Management can be achieved at higher levels
                depending
                on the
                existence of practices at the higher MIL levels (MIL-2 through MIL-5).</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Scoring Rubric</h5>
        <div class="text-underline">Step 1</div>
        <div>Each Practice in a Domain is scored as follows.</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
            <li>performed when the question is answered with a “Yes” (green)</li>
            <li>incompletely performed when the question is answered with an “Incomplete” (yellow)</li>
            <li>not performed when a question is answered with a “No” (red)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-underline">Step 2</div>
        <div>Each Goal within the Domain is then scored as follows.</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
            <li>achieved when all practices are performed (green)</li>
            <li>partially achieved when some practices are performed (yellow)</li>
            <li>not achieved when no practices are performed (red)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-underline">Step 3</div>
        <div>External Dependencies Management is assigned a MIL level based on the following criteria.</div>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 2%;">
            <li>MIL-0 if only some of the goals are achieved</li>
            <li>MIL-1 if all of the goals are achieved in each domain</li>
            <li>MIL-2 if MIL-1 is achieved and all of the MIL-2 questions are answered YES</li>
            <li>MIL-3 if MIL-2 is achieved and all of the MIL-3 questions are answered YES</li>
            <li>MIL-4 if MIL-3 is achieved and all of the MIL-4 questions are answered YES</li>
            <li>MIL-5 if MIL-4 is achieved and all of the MIL-5 questions are answered YES</li>
