  <h1>2. Model Architecture</h1>
  <p>
    The model is organized into 10 domains. Each domain is a logical grouping of cybersecurity practices. The practices
    within a domain are grouped by objective—target achievements that support the domain. Within each objective, the
    practices are ordered by maturity indicator levels (MILs).
  </p>
  <p>
    The following sections include additional information about the domains and the MILs.
  </p>

  <h1 id="toc-domains-objectives-practices">2.1 Domains, Objectives, and Practices</h1>
  <p>
    The C2M2 includes 356 cybersecurity practices, which are grouped into 10 domains. These practices represent the
    activities an organization can perform to establish and mature capability in the domain. For example, the Asset,
    Change,
    and Configuration Management domain is a group of practices that an organization can perform to establish and mature
    asset management, change management, and configuration management capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The practices within each domain are organized into objectives, which represent achievements that support the
    domain.
    For example, the Asset, Change, and Configuration Management domain comprises five objectives:
  </p>
  <ol class="mb-3">
    <li>Manage IT and OT Asset Inventory</li>
    <li>Manage Information Asset Inventory</li>
    <li>Manage IT and OT Asset Configurations</li>
    <li>Manage Changes to IT and OT Assets</li>
    <li>Management Activities for the ASSET domain</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Each of the objectives in a domain comprises a set of practices, which are ordered by MIL. Figure 1 summarizes the
    elements of each domain.

    For a more in-depth description of the C2M2 domains, refer to the C2M2 V2.1 model document
    available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2" target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.
  </p>

  <h1 id="toc-maturity-indicator-levels">2.2 Maturity Indicator Levels</h1>
  <p>
    The model defines four maturity indicator levels (MILs), MIL0 through MIL3, which apply independently to each domain
    in
    the model. The MILs define a dual progression of maturity: an approach progression and a management progression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Four aspects of the MILs are important for understanding and applying the model:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The maturity indicator levels apply independently to each domain. As a result, an organization using the model may
      be
      operating at different MIL ratings in different domains. For example, an organization could be operating at MIL1
      in one
      domain, MIL2 in another domain, and MIL3 in a third domain.
    </li>
    <li>
      The MILs—MIL0 through MIL3—are cumulative within each domain. To earn a MIL in a given domain, an organization
      must
      perform all of the practices in that level and its predecessor level. For example, an organization must perform
      all of
      the domain practices in MIL1 and MIL2 to achieve MIL2 in the domain. Similarly, the organization must perform all
      practices in MIL1, MIL2, and MIL3 to achieve MIL3.
    </li>
    <li>
      Establishing a target MIL for each domain is an effective strategy for using the model to guide cybersecurity
      program
      improvement. Organizations should become familiar with the practices in the model prior to determining target
      MILs.
      Then, they can focus gap analysis activities and improvement efforts on achieving those target levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      Practice performance and MIL achievement need to align with business objectives and the organization’s
      cybersecurity
      program strategy. Striving to achieve the highest MIL in all domains may not be optimal. Companies should evaluate
      the
      costs of achieving a specific MIL versus its potential benefits. However, the model was designed so that all
      companies,
      regardless of size, should be able to achieve MIL1 across all domains.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For a more in-depth description of the C2M2 MILs and the concept of dual progression, refer to the
    C2M2 V2.1 model document available here: <a href="https://energy.gov/C2M2"
      target="_blank">https://energy.gov/C2M2</a>.
  </p>

  <h1 id="toc-maturity-indicator-level-scoring">2.3 Maturity Indicator Level Scoring</h1>
  <p>
    MIL achievement scores are derived from responses entered into the C2M2 Self-Evaluation Tool. Responses are chosen
    from
    a four-point scale: Fully Implemented (FI), Largely Implemented (LI), Partially Implemented (PI), and Not
    Implemented
    (NI). A MIL is achieved when all practices in that MIL and all preceding MILs receive responses of Fully Implemented
    or
    Largely Implemented. A MIL is not achieved if any practices in that MIL or a preceding MIL have received a response
    of
    Partially Implemented or Not Implemented.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, achieving a MIL in a domain requires the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in that MIL</li>
    <li>Responses of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented for all practices in all preceding MILs in that domain
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For example, to achieve MIL1 in a domain with four MIL1 practices, all four MIL1 practices have responses of Fully
    Implemented or Largely Implemented. To achieve MIL2 in that same domain, all MIL1 and MIL2 practices must have
    responses
    of Fully Implemented or Largely Implemented.
  </p>
